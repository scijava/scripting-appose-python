/**
 * An Appose worker process that stays resident across tasks: it is started
 * on first use, reused afterward, and ended only on request.
 * <p>
 * Keeping the worker alive is what makes repeated runs fast: modules the
 * worker has imported stay imported, and objects a task hands to
 * {@code task.export(...)} stay available to later tasks. The price is that
 * the worker's memory, GPU memory included, stays claimed until
 * {@link #release()} ends the process, which is the only reliable way to
 * free it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A worker runs in a {@link LazyEnvironment}, which it builds if needed; any
 * number of workers may share one environment. If the worker dies (e.g. it
 * crashes, or {@link #kill()} is called), the next task transparently starts
 * a new process.
