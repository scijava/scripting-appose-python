/**
 * Receives notifications about the build of an Appose environment, from
 * start to finish.
 * <p>
 * Unlike the individual {@code Builder.subscribe*} callbacks, every
 * notification names the environment it concerns, and the build's start and
 * end are events too, so that one listener can follow several builds.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Note that {@link #buildError} receives the build tool's stderr stream,
 * which is <em>not</em> a failure report: pixi, for example, writes all of
 * its ordinary status there, including its success message. A failed build
 * is signaled only by a non-null error passed to {@link #buildFinished}.
